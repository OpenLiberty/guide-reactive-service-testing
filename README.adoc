Learn how to test reactive Java microservices in true-to-production environments using Testcontainers.


== What you'll learn

You will learn how to write integration tests for reactive Java microservices and to run the tests in true-to-production environments by using containers with https://java.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers^] and JUnit. Testcontainers tests your containerized application from outside the container so that you are testing the exact same image that runs in production. The reactive application in this guide sends and receives messages between services by using an external message broker, https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka^]. Using an external message broker enables asynchronous communications between services so that requests are non-blocking and decoupled from responses. You can learn more about reactive Java services that use an external message broker to manage communications in the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-reactive-messaging.html[Creating reactive Java microservices^] guide.

*True-to-production integration testing with Testcontainers*

Tests sometimes pass during the development and testing stages of an application's lifecycle but then fail in production because of differences between your development and production environments. While you can create mock objects and custom setups to minimize differences between environments, it is difficult to mimic a production system for an application that uses an external messaging system. Testcontainers addresses this problem by enabling the testing of applications in the same Docker containers that you’ll use in production. As a result, your environment remains the same throughout the application’s lifecycle – from development, through testing, and into production. You can learn more about Testcontainers in the https://openliberty.io/guides/testcontainers.html[Building true-to-production integration tests with Testcontainers^] guide.


== Additional prerequisites

You need to have Docker installed. For installation instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker documentation]. You will build and run the microservices in Docker containers. An installation of Apache Kafka is provided in another Docker container.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
In this IBM Cloud environment, you need to change the user home to ***/home/project*** by running the following command:
```bash
sudo usermod -d /home/project theia
```
endif::[]


=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the tests, go to the `finish` directory and run the following Maven goal to install the `models` artifact to the local Maven repository:

[role='command']
```
cd finish
mvn -pl models install
```



Next, navigate to the `finish/system` directory and run the following Maven goal to build the `system` microservice and run the integration tests on an Open Liberty server in a container:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
cd system
mvn verify
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
export TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true
cd system
mvn verify
```
--

You will see the following output:

[role='no_copy']
```
 Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 52.46 s - in it.io.openliberty.guides.system.SystemServiceIT

 Results:

 Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

 BUILD SUCCESS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total time:  57.710 s
 Finished at: 2024-02-01T08:48:15-08:00
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This command might take some time to run the first time because the dependencies and the Docker image for Open Liberty must download. If you run the same command again, it will be faster.

You can also try out the `inventory` integration tests by repeating the same commands in the `finish/inventory` directory.

The example reactive application consists of the `system` and `inventory` microservices. The `system` microservice produces messages to the Kafka message broker, and the `inventory` microservice consumes messages from the Kafka message broker. You will write integration tests to see how you can use the Kafka consumer and producer client APIs to test each service. Kafka Testcontainers and JUnit are already included as required test dependencies in your Maven `pom.xml` files for the [hotspot=dependencies file=0]`system` and [hotspot=dependencies file=1]`inventory` microservices.

The `start` directory contains three directories: the `system` microservice directory, the `inventory` microservice directory, and the `models` directory. The `models` directory contains the model class that defines the structure of the system load data that is used in the application. Run the following Maven goal to install the packaged `models` artifact to the local Maven repository so it can be used later by the `system` and `inventory` microservices:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models install
```

=== Launching the system microservice in dev mode with container support

Start the microservices in dev mode by running the following command to launch a Kafka instance that replicates the production environment. The `startKafka` script launches a local Kafka container. It also establishes a [hotspot=dockerNetworkSetup file=3]`reactive-app` network that allows the `system` and `inventory` microservices to connect to the Kafka message broker.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startKafka.bat
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startKafka.sh
```
--


Navigate to the `start/system` directory.

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start/system
```

In this IBM Cloud environment, you must first create the ***logs*** directory by running the following commands:
```bash
mkdir -p /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start/system/target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs
chmod 777 /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start/system/target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs
```
endif::[]

To launch the `system` microservice in dev mode with container support, configure the container by specifying the options within the [hotspot=devc_config file=0]`<containerRunOpts>` element to connect to the [hotspot=reactive-app file=0]`reactive-app` network and expose the container port.

Run the following goal to start the `system` microservice in dev mode with container support:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:devc
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
export TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true
mvn liberty:devc
```

For more information about disabling Ryuk, see the https://java.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/#disabling-ryuk[Testcontainers custom configuration^] document.

After you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:

https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[Dev mode^] holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, or open the project in your editor.

The `system` microservice actively seeks a Kafka topic for message push operations. After the Kafka service starts, the `system` microservice connects to the Kafka message broker by using the [hotspot=kafkaConfig file=2]`mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.bootstrap.servers` property. When you run your app in dev mode with container support, the running `system` container exposes its service on the [hotspot=systemPortExpose file=4]`9083` port for testing purposes.

=== Testing the system microservice

Now you can start writing the test by using Testcontainers.

Construct the [hotspot=buildSystemImage file=0]`systemImage` by using the `ImageFromDockerfile` class, which allows Testcontainers to build the Docker image from a Dockerfile during the test run time. For instance, the provided Dockerfile at the specified [hotspot file=3]`./Dockerfile` paths is used to generate the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` image.

Use the [hotspot=kafkaContainer file=0]`kafkaContainer` class to instantiate the `kafkaContainer` test container, initiating the `confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest` Docker image. Similarly, use the `GenericContainer` class to create the [hotspot=systemContainer file=0]`systemContainer` test container, starting the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` Docker image.
 
The [hotspot=withListener file=0]`withListener()` is configured to `kafka:19092`, as the containerized `system` microservice functions as an additional producer. Therefore, the Kafka container needs to set up a listener to accommodate this requirement. For further details on using an additional consumer or producer with Kafka container, see the https://java.testcontainers.org/modules/kafka/[official Kafka test container documentation^]

Because containers are isolated by default, facilitating communication between the `kafkaContainer` and the `systemContainer` requires placing them on the same [hotspot=network1 hotspot=network2 hotspot=network3 file=0]`network`. The [hotspot=dependsOn file=0]`dependsOn()` method is used to indicate that the `system` microservice container starts only after ensuring the readiness of the Kafka container. 

Before you start the `systemContainer`, you must override the `mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.bootstrap.servers` property with `kafka:19092` by using the [hotspot=bootstrapServerSetup file=0]`withEnv()` method. This step creates a listener in the Kafka container that is  configured to handle an additional producer.

The test uses the [hotspot=KafkaConsumer hotspot=KafkaConsumerUsage file=0]`KafkaConsumer` client API, configuring the consumer to use the [hotspot=BootstrapSetting1 file=0]`BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG` property with the Kafka broker address if a local `system` microservice container is present. In the absence of a local service container, it uses the [hotspot=BootstrapSetting2 file=0]`getBootstrapServers()` method to obtain the broker address from the Kafka test container. Then, the consumer is set up to consume messages from the [hotspot=systemLoadTopic file=0]`system.load` topic within the `Kafka` container.

To consume messages from a stream, the messages need to be deserialized from bytes. Kafka has its own default deserializer, but a custom deserializer is provided for you. The deserializer is configured by the [hotspot=valueDeserializer file=0]`VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG` property and is implemented in the [hotspot=SystemLoadDeserializer file=1]`SystemLoad` class. To learn more about Kafka APIs and their usage, see the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#api[official Kafka Documentation^].

The running `system` microservice container produces messages to the [hotspot=systemLoad file=2]`systemLoad` Kafka topic, as denoted by the [hotspot=Outgoing file=2]`@Outgoing` annotation. The [hotspot=testCpuStatus file=0]`testCpuStatus()` test method uses the [hotspot=poll file=0]`consumer.poll()` method from the `KafkaConsumer` client API to retrieve a record from Kafka every 3 seconds within a specified timeout limit. This record is produced by the system service. Then, the method uses [hotspot=assert file=0]`Assertions` to verify that the polled record aligns with the expected record.

== Testing with the Kafka producer client

The `inventory` microservice is tested in the same way as the `system` microservice. The only difference is that the `inventory` microservice consumes messages, which means that tests are written to use the Kafka producer client.

=== Launching the inventory microservice in dev mode with container

Navigate to the `start/inventory` directory.

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start/inventory
```

First, create the ***logs*** directory by running the following commands:
```bash
mkdir -p /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start/inventory/target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs
chmod 777 /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start/inventory/target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs
```
endif::[]

Run the following goal to start the `inventory` microservice in dev mode with container support:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:devc
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:devc
```
--

=== Building a test REST client

Create a REST client interface to access the `inventory` microservice.

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Open another command-line session by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE.
endif::[]

----
include::finish/inventory/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResourceClient.java[]
----

The `InventoryResourceClient` interface declares the [hotspot=getSystems file=0]`getSystems()` and [hotspot=resetSystems file=0]`resetSystems()` methods for accessing the corresponding endpoints within the `inventory` microservice.


=== Implementing tests for the inventory microservice

Now you can start writing the test by using Testcontainers.

The [hotspot=InventoryServiceIT file=0]`InventoryServiceIT` class uses the [hotspot=KafkaProducer hotspot=KafkaProducer2 file=0]`KafkaProducer` client API to generate messages in the test environment, which are then consumed by the `inventory` microservice container.

Similar to `system` microservice testing, the configuration of the producer [hotspot=BootstrapServerConfig hotspot=BootstrapServerConfig2 file=0]`BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG` property depends on whether a local `inventory` microservice container is detected.  In addition, the producer is configured with a custom serializer provided in the [hotspot=SystemLoadSerializer file=1]`SystemLoad` class.

The [hotspot=testCpuUsage file=0]`testCpuUsage` test method uses the [hotspot=systemLoadMsg file=0]`producer.send()` method, using the `KafkaProducer` client API, to generate the `Systemload` message. Subsequently, it uses [hotspot=assert hotspot=assert2 hotspot=assert3 file=0]`Assertions` to verify that the response from the `inventory` microservice aligns with the expected outcome.
