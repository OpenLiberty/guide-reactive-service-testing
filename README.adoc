Learn how to test reactive Java microservices in true-to-production environments using Testcontainers.


== What you'll learn

You will learn how to write integration tests for reactive Java microservices and to run the tests in true-to-production environments by using containers with https://java.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers^] and JUnit. Testcontainers tests your containerized application from outside the container so that you are testing the exact same image that runs in production. The reactive application in this guide sends and receives messages between services by using an external message broker, https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka^]. Using an external message broker enables asynchronous communications between services so that requests are non-blocking and decoupled from responses. You can learn more about reactive Java services that use an external message broker to manage communications in the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-reactive-messaging.html[Creating reactive Java microservices^] guide.

*True-to-production integration testing with Testcontainers*

Tests sometimes pass during the development and testing stages of an application's lifecycle but then fail in production because of differences between your development and production environments. While you can create mock objects and custom setups to minimize differences between environments, it is difficult to mimic a production system for an application that uses an external messaging system. Testcontainers addresses this problem by enabling the testing of applications in the same Docker containers that you’ll use in production. As a result, your environment remains the same throughout the application’s lifecycle – from development, through testing, and into production. You can learn more about Testcontainers in the https://openliberty.io/guides/testcontainers.html[Building true-to-production integration tests with Testcontainers^] guide.


== Additional prerequisites

You need to have Docker installed. For installation instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker documentation]. You will build and run the microservices in Docker containers. An installation of Apache Kafka is provided in another Docker container.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the tests, go to the `finish` directory and run the following Maven goal to install the `models` artifact to the local Maven repository:

[role='command']
```
cd finish
mvn -pl models install
```



Next, navigate to the `finish/system` directory and run the following Maven goal to build the `system` service and run the integration tests on an Open Liberty server in a container:

[role='command']
```
cd system
mvn verify
```

You will see the following output:

[role='no_copy']
```
 Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 33.001 s - in it.io.openliberty.guides.system.SystemServiceIT

 Results:

 Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0


 --- maven-failsafe-plugin:2.22.2:verify (verify) @ system ---
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BUILD SUCCESS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total time:  52.817 s
 Finished at: 2020-03-13T16:28:55-04:00
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This command might take some time to run the first time because the dependencies and the Docker image for Open Liberty must download. If you run the same command again, it will be faster.

You can also try out the `inventory` integration tests by repeating the same commands in the `finish/inventory` directory.


== Testing with the Kafka consumer client

The example reactive application consists of the `system` and `inventory` microservices. The `system` microservice produces messages to the Kafka message broker, and the `inventory` microservice consumes messages from the Kafka message broker. You will write integration tests to see how you can use the Kafka consumer and producer client APIs to test each service. Kafka Testcontainers and JUnit have already been included as required test dependencies in your Maven `pom.xml` files for the [hotspot=dependencies file=0]`system` and [hotspot=dependencies file=1]`inventory` services.

The `start` directory contains three directories: the `system` service directory, the `inventory` service directory, and the `models` directory. The `models` directory contains the model class that defines the structure of the system load data that is used in the application. Run the following Maven goal to install the packaged `models` artifact to the local Maven repository so it can be used later by the `system` and `inventory` services:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models install
```

// The test will cover scenarios involving both a running local `system/inventory` service and a scenario where the local service is not running. In the case of a running local service, a local Kafka instance will be established to facilitate the required broker connection from the development mode container. In the absence of a running local service, a Kafka Testcontainer will be initiated to serve as the broker for the system and inventory services. 

=== Launching system service in dev mode with container

Initiate local testing by executing the following command to start a Kafka instance replicating the production environment. The `startKafka` script will launch a local Kafka container, enabling the `system/inventory` service to run in development mode with container goals. The script also establishes a `reactive-app` docker network, allowing the local `system/inventory` service to connect to the Kafka service's `bootstrap server`:
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startKafka.sh
```

// With Open Liberty devc mode, you can use Testcontainers to run tests on an operational Open Liberty server. 
To execute the system service with the `devc` goal, configure the container by specifying the options within [hotspot=devc config file=0]`<containerRunOpts>`. The development mode container is configured to connect to the `reactive-app` Docker network.

Navigate to the `start/system` directory.

The Open Liberty Maven plug-in includes a `devc` goal that builds a Docker image, mounts the required directories, binds the required ports, and then runs the application inside of a container. This https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode^], also listens for any changes in the application source code or configuration and rebuilds the image and restarts the container as necessary.

Build and run the container by running the `devc` goal from the `start/system` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:devc
```

After you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:


[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, or open the project in your editor.

Now you can add your test files.

The active `system` service actively seeks a Kafka topic for message push operations. Upon the successful initialization of a Kafka service, the `system` service establishes connectivity by utilizing the identical broker address. Additionally, the running `system` exposes its service on port `9083` for testing purposes in `devc` mode.


=== Implementing tests for the System service

You will create an integration test to test the basic functionality of the system microservice. If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code.

Construct the [hotspot=buildSystemImage file=0]`systemImage` using the `ImageFromDockerfile` class, which allows Testcontainers to build the Docker image from a Dockerfile during the test runtime. For instance, the provided Dockerfile at the specified paths `./Dockerfile` is used to generate the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` image.

Utilize the [hotspot=kafkaContainer file=0]`kafkaContainer` class to instantiate the `kafkaContainer` test container, initiating the `confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest` Docker image. Similarly, employ the `GenericContainer` class to create the [hotspot=systemContainer file=0]`systemContainer` test container, starting the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` Docker image.

Two containers are implemented for testing the `system` service: the `kafkaContainer` container is responsible for receiving messages from the system service, which is hosted in the `systemContainer`. It's important to note that [hotspot=withListener file=0]`withListener()` has been configured to `kafka:19092`, as the system service will function as an additional producer. Therefore, the Kafka container needs to set up a listener to accommodate this requirement. For further details on utilizing additional consumer or producer with Kafka container, please visit https://java.testcontainers.org/modules/kafka/[official Kafka Test Container Documentation^]

Since containers are isolated by default, facilitating communication between the `kafkaContainer` and the `systemContainer` requires placing them on the same [hotspot=network1 hotspot=network2 file=0]`network`.

The [hotspot=dependsOn file=0]`dependsOn()` method is utilized to indicate that the `system` service container should commence only after ensuring the readiness of the kafka container. During the testing procedures encompassing both `mvn liberty:devc` and `mvn verify` integration tests, a method named [hotspot=isServiceRunning file=0]`isServiceRunning` has been introduced. This method serves the purpose of verifying the presence of a local container hosting the system service. 

Upon detection of a local system service container, the initiation of the test container is bypassed. In this scenario, the testing is directed towards the service exported by the system service container operating in devc mode. In the event that a local service container is not detected, the testing framework proceeds to initiate the test container. Prior to initiating the systemContainer, it is imperative to override the `mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.bootstrap.servers` property with `kafka:19092` using the [hotspot=bootstrapServerSetup file=0]`withEnv()` method. This step is necessary due to the establishment of a listener in the Kafka container, configured to handle an additional producer.

The test utilizes the [hotspot=KafkaConsumer hotspot=KafkaConsumer2 file=0]`KafkaConsumer` client API, with the consumer client configured to consume messages from the [hotspot=systemLoadTopic file=0]`system.load` topic within the `kafka` container. If a local system service container is detected, the [hotspot=BootstrapSetting1 file=0]`BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG` will be configured to utilize the broker address of the Kafka service running within the local container. Alternatively, if a local service container is not detected, the [hotspot=BootstrapSetting2 file=0]`BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG` will be configured to use the broker address from the Kafka Testcontainer.

To learn more about Kafka APIs and their usage, please refer to the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#api[official Kafka Documentation^].

To consume messages from a stream, the messages need to be deserialized from bytes. Kafka has its own default deserializer, but a custom deserializer is provided for you. The deserializer is configured to the consumer’s [hotspot=valueDeserializer file=0]`valueDeserializer` and is implemented in the [hotspot=SystemLoadDeserializer file=1]`SystemLoad` class.

The running `system` service container produces messages to the [hotspot=systemLoad file=2]`systemLoad` Kafka topic, as denoted by the [hotspot=Outgoing file=2]`@Outgoing` annotation. The [hotspot=testCpuStatus file=0]`testCpuStatus()` test method [hotspot=poll file=0]`polls` a record from Kafka every 3 seconds until the timeout limit. It then [hotspot=assert file=0]`verifies` that the record polled matches the expected record.

== Testing with the Kafka producer client

The `inventory` service is tested in the same way as the `system` service. The only difference is that the `inventory` service consumes messages, which means that tests are written to use the Kafka producer client.

=== Configuring your containers

Navigate to the `start/inventory` directory.
// cloud hosted instruction
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start/inventory
```
endif::[]

=== Implementing tests for the Inventory service

Build and run the container by running the `devc` goal from the `start/inventory` directory.

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:devc
```

=== Writing the RESTful client interface

Create a RESTful client interface for the inventory microservice in the system microservice. This interface declares [hotspot=getSystems file=3]`getSystems()` method for accessing system status in the integration test.

The [hotspot=InventoryServiceIT file=0]`InventoryServiceIT` class utilizes the [hotspot=KafkaProducer hotspot=KafkaProducer file=0]`KafkaProducer` client API to generate messages in the test environment, which are then consumed by the inventory service container.

Similar to system service testing, the configuration of the producer client's `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG` depends on whether a local inventory service container is detected. In this scenario, it will utilize the [hotspot=BootstrapServerConfig file=0]`broker address` exported from the local Kafka container or the [hotspot=BootstrapServerConfig2 file=0]`broker address` from the kafka Testcontainer. In addition, the producer is configured with a custom serializer provided in the [hotspot=SystemLoadSerializer file=1]`SystemLoad` class.

Upon starting the container, the [hotspot=getSystems file=3]`getSystems` method declared in the `InventoryResourceClient` is invoked. To facilitate this, a [hotspot=ResteasyClient file=0]`ResteasyClient` has been introduced to construct a REST client, enabling HTTP requests to be made to the running application.

When configuring a REST client that accepts a URL path as input, the URL settings will adapt depending on the identification of a local inventory service. if a service container is detected, the [hotspot=urlPathSetup1 file=0]`urlPath` will be set to the local service address `http://localhost:9085`. Conversely, in the absence of a detected local service container, the [hotspot=urlPathSetup2 file=0]`urlPath` will be configured to employ the inventory service port from the inventory container.  

The [hotspot=testCpuUsage file=0]`testCpuUsage` test method produces a message to Kafka and then [hotspot=assert hotspot=assert2 hotspot=assert3 file=0]`verifies` that the response from the `inventory` service matches what is expected.
