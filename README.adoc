Learn how to test reactive Java microservices in true-to-production environments using Testcontainers.


== What you'll learn

You will learn how to write integration tests for reactive Java microservices and to run the tests in true-to-production environments by using containers with https://java.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers^] and JUnit. Testcontainers tests your containerized application from outside the container so that you are testing the exact same image that runs in production. The reactive application in this guide sends and receives messages between services by using an external message broker, https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka^]. Using an external message broker enables asynchronous communications between services so that requests are non-blocking and decoupled from responses. You can learn more about reactive Java services that use an external message broker to manage communications in the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-reactive-messaging.html[Creating reactive Java microservices^] guide.

*True-to-production integration testing with Testcontainers*

Tests sometimes pass during the development and testing stages of an application's lifecycle but then fail in production because of differences between your development and production environments. While you can create mock objects and custom setups to minimize differences between environments, it is difficult to mimic a production system for an application that uses an external messaging system. Testcontainers addresses this problem by enabling the testing of applications in the same Docker containers that you’ll use in production. As a result, your environment remains the same throughout the application’s lifecycle – from development, through testing, and into production. You can learn more about Testcontainers in the https://openliberty.io/guides/testcontainers.html[Building true-to-production integration tests with Testcontainers^] guide.


== Additional prerequisites

You need to have Docker installed. For installation instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker documentation]. You will build and run the microservices in Docker containers. An installation of Apache Kafka is provided in another Docker container.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the tests, go to the `finish` directory and run the following Maven goal to install the `models` artifact to the local Maven repository:

[role='command']
```
cd finish
mvn -pl models install
```



Next, navigate to the `finish/system` directory and run the following Maven goal to build the `system` service and run the integration tests on an Open Liberty server in a container:

[role='command']
```
cd system
mvn verify
```

You will see the following output:

[role='no_copy']
```
 Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 33.001 s - in it.io.openliberty.guides.system.SystemServiceIT

 Results:

 Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0


 --- maven-failsafe-plugin:2.22.2:verify (verify) @ system ---
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BUILD SUCCESS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total time:  52.817 s
 Finished at: 2020-03-13T16:28:55-04:00
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This command might take some time to run the first time because the dependencies and the Docker image for Open Liberty must download. If you run the same command again, it will be faster.

You can also try out the `inventory` integration tests by repeating the same commands in the `finish/inventory` directory.


== Testing with the Kafka consumer client

//File 0

//File 1

----

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.
// cloud hosted instruction
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start
```
endif::[]

The example reactive application consists of the `system` and `inventory` microservices. The `system` microservice produces messages to the Kafka message broker, and the `inventory` microservice consumes messages from the Kafka message broker. You will write integration tests to see how you can use the Kafka consumer and producer client APIs to test each service. Kafka Testcontainers and JUnit have already been included as required test dependencies in your Maven `pom.xml` files for the [hotspot=dependencies file=0]`system` and [hotspot=dependencies file=1]`inventory` services.

The `start` directory contains three directories: the `system` service directory, the `inventory` service directory, and the `models` directory. The `models` directory contains the model class that defines the structure of the system load data that is used in the application. Run the following Maven goal to install the packaged `models` artifact to the local Maven repository so it can be used later by the `system` and `inventory` services:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models install
```

With Open Liberty dev mode, you can use Testcontainers to run tests on an already running Open Liberty server. Navigate to the `start/system` directory.

// cloud hosted instruction
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start/system
```
endif::[]

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/devmode-lmp33-start.adoc[]

Now you can add your test files.

The running `system` service searches for a Kafka topic to push its messages to. Because there are not yet any running Kafka services, the `system` service throws errors. Later in the guide, you will write and run tests that start a Kafka Testcontainer that can communicate with the `system` service. This will resolve the errors that you see now.


=== Testing your system service with Testcontainer

You will create an integration test to test the basic functionality of the system microservice. If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code.

Construct the [hotspot=buildSystemImage file=0] `systemImage` using the `ImageFromDockerfile class`, which allows Testcontainers to build Docker images from a Dockerfile during the test runtime. For instance, the provided Dockerfiles at the specified paths `./Dockerfile` is used to generate the system:1.0-SNAPSHOT images.

Use the kafkaContainer class to create the `kafkaContainer` test container to start up the `confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest` Docker image, and use GenericContainer class to create the `systemContainer` test container to start up the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` Docker image,  

Two containers are used for testing the `system` service: the [hotspot=kafkaContainer file=0]`kafkaContainer` container, which receives messages from the `system` service, and the [hotspot=system file=0]`systemContainer` container. Note that [hotspot=withListener file=0]`withListener()` has been set to `kafka:19092` because the system service will be used as an additional producer. Therefore, the Kafka container needs to set up a listener to accommodate this requirement. For more information of using additional consumer or producer with Kafka container please visit https://java.testcontainers.org/modules/kafka/[official Kafka Test Container Documentation^]

Since containers are isolated by default, placing both the `kafkaContainer` and the `systemContainer` on the same [hotspot=network1 hotspot=network2 file=0]`network` allows them to communicate. 

The [hotspot=dependsOn file=0]`dependsOn()` method specifies that the `system` service container must wait until the `kafka` container is ready before it can start. In addition, before starting the systemContainer, as the listener has been set up for the Kafka container to handle an additional producer, the `mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.bootstrap.servers` property needs to be overridden with `kafka:19092` using [hotspot=bootstrapServerSetup file=0]`withEnv()` method.

The test uses the [hotspot=KafkaConsumer hotspot=KafkaConsumer2 file=0]`KafkaConsumer` client API. The consumer client is configured to consume messages from the [hotspot=systemLoadTopic file=0]`system.load` topic in the `kafka` container. To learn more about Kafka APIs and how to use them, check out the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#api[official Kafka Documentation^].

To consume messages from a stream, the messages need to be deserialized from bytes. Kafka has its own default deserializer, but a custom deserializer is provided for you. The deserializer is configured to the consumer’s [hotspot=valueDeserializer file=0]`valueDeserializer` and is implemented in the [hotspot=SystemLoadDeserializer file=1]`SystemLoad` class.

The running `system` service container produces messages to the [hotspot=systemLoad file=2]`systemLoad` Kafka topic, as denoted by the [hotspot=Outgoing file=2]`@Outgoing` annotation. The [hotspot=testCpuStatus file=0]`testCpuStatus()` test method [hotspot=poll file=0]`polls` a record from Kafka every 3 seconds until the timeout limit. It then [hotspot=assert file=0]`verifies` that the record polled matches the expected record.

== Testing with the Kafka producer client

The `inventory` service is tested in the same way as the `system` service. The only difference is that the `inventory` service consumes messages, which means that tests are written to use the Kafka producer client.

=== Configuring your containers

Navigate to the `start/inventory` directory.
// cloud hosted instruction
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-reactive-service-testing/start/inventory
```
endif::[]

=== Testing your inventory service with Testcontainer

As you did with the `system` service, run Open Liberty in dev mode to listen for file changes:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:dev
```

=== Writing the RESTful client interface

Create a RESTful client interface for the inventory microservice in the system microservice. This interface declares `getSystems()` method for accessing system status in the integration test.

The [hotspot=InventoryServiceIT file=0]`InventoryServiceIT` class uses the [hotspot=KafkaProducer hotspot=KafkaProducer file=0]`KafkaProducer` client API to produce messages in the test environment for the `inventory` service container to consume. 

The producer client is configured to use the kafkaContainer's [hotspot=BootstrapServerConfig file=0]`bootstrapServer`, and custom serializer provided in the [hotspot=SystemLoadSerializer file=1]`SystemLoad` class.

After start the container, in order to invoke the [hotspot=getSystems file=3]`getSystems` method declared in the `InventoryResourceClient`. An `ResteasyClient` has been introduced to build an REST client, which allows HTTP requests to be made to the running application.

The [hotspot=testCpuUsage file=0]`testCpuUsage` test method produces a message to Kafka and then [hotspot=assert hotspot=assert2 hotspot=assert3 file=0]`verifies` that the response from the `inventory` service matches what is expected.
